# numerical-analysis
MATLAB codes and numerical methods implemented as part of the Numerical Analysis class ( at UPV).
## Description
This repository contains MATLAB implementations of various numerical methods, including but not limited to:

- **Non-linear equations solving methods**: Techniques for finding approximate solutions to equations that cannot be solved analytically.
- **Discretization approximation**: Methods for approximating functions or discrete data, including interpolation and curve fitting.
- **Continuous approximation**: Techniques for approximating continuous functions, such as Taylor series and polynomial approximation.
- **Numerical differentiation and integration**: Methods for calculating derivatives and integrals of functions when analytical solutions are not available.
- **Initial value problems**: Numerical techniques for solving ordinary differential equations with initial conditions, such as Euler's and Runge-Kutta methods.
